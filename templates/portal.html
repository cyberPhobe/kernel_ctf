<h2>W2 Information</h2>
<h3>Attention Employees:</h3>
<p>Hello, it's Kevin!</p>

<p>I'm excited to write this memo to you guys! I'm posting this message as a reminder that we will be
    getting your W2 forms handed back to you at the party this week! Here's what you can do so I can find you faster:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Wear our employee T-shirt so I can easily find you</li>
    <li>Let me know if you're picking up more than one W2 form in advance for your friend</li>
    <li>Let me know if you'd rather have this mailed to you instead</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, and have a great rest of your day!!! :)</p>

<h2>Important Message from the CEO</h2>
<h2>Attention Everyone:</h2>
<p>It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you that in the past month, we had some of our employees' identity
    stolen. As a result, our server was compromised by the evildoer as well. Some of you noticed that our site
    was down for a few days, and that was a result of us attempting to fix the server and purge any malware that was installed.<br><br>
    What we know about the criminal so far: their favorite computer language was Python, they are a bother to society, and they seem to have 
    spelling issues (we found "llehs" in our website and believe it's their calling card).<br><br>
    We have been cooperating with law enforcement, and will hopefully bring our employees justice.
</p>
